### Research & Planning Log
#### Friday, 02/18
* 8 - 9:30 Spent morning looking up scaffoliding and researching different approaches of meshing C#/.Net and React.
* 9:30 - 10:30 Considered what I wanted the project to achieve and briefly wrote capstone proposal.
* 10:30 - 11:30 Studied what is possible with the Spoonacular API.

#### Thursday, 02/24
* 3:30 - 4:00 Researched Spoonacular Api more and attempted to see what I would need to make an api call. Also updated my capstone proposal.

#### Friday, 02/25
* 8:09 - 8:39 Working towards making an API call. Reading through week 5 of the C# lessons.
* 8:39 - 9:09 Continuing to build the api call, focusing on the model at the moment, used json2csharp website to convert the api call to a model.
* 9:09 - 9:39 Built the api call, now trying to connect it to React.
* 9:39 - 10:09 Decided after looking through bugs and documentation to switch to a new project that is completely C#.
* 10:09 - 10:30 Added some files to the c# program as a baseline, taking an early lunch to destress after throwing out my old project.
* 11:50 - 12:20 Continuing to try and get the api call to appear on screen. Added several files in the models, controllers, and views folders.
* 12:20 - 12:49 Ran into a wall where I am not formatting my model correctly, will continue trying to get past this obstacle.
* 12:49 - 1:20 Figured out the last hurdle but now having an issue where local host is saying that this site can't provide a secure connection.
* 1:20 - 1:53 Trying to deserialize an object.
* 1:53 - 2:19 Continuing to try and deserialize an api call, thinking about switching to a different api call.
* 2:19 - 2:56 looking up how to deserialize json objects in google.
* 2:56 - 3:34 reading up on JArray and how to make it work.
* 3:34 - 3:55 Looking for a better formatted api, stepping away from the computer for 30 mins.
* 4:00 - 4:30 Ended up finding a way to make the spoonacular api work, on to the next hurdle.
* 4:30 - 4:48 Added in a front page that displays a full days worth of meals.
* 4:48 - 5:28 Researched Mysql and reread lessons on how to save information.

* 5:00 - 5:30  Attempting to add mysql db to the project, if it will work well with the api call has yet to be seen.
* 5:30 - 5:58 Got the api webpage to start up again, had to add entity framework into the using statements in startup.cs.
* 6:00 - 6:27 Relearned how Linq works and created a meals controller. Looking into how I'm going to get info from the API page to the database index page.
* 6:27 - 6:58 Got the db table set up and now going through errors trying to make it appear on the screen.
* 6:58 - 7:32 Got the database screen to appear. On to creating a form for users to put meal info into.
* 9:00 - 9:30 Now stuck trying to figure out how to get a form to appear on the api view. 
* 9:30 - 9:56 Rethought how my app will work and in the process of putting the form in.
* 9:56 - 10:28 Added in a details rough draft. Will have to redo the api call to change it to a better type of call.

* 4:27 - 4:58 Researched a better api call from the spoonacular api.
* 4:58 - 5:27 Hit a block on how to pass a variable from a form into an api call.
* 5:27 - 6:26 Spent the past hour trying to find an example of a variable being taken from a form and put into an api call.
* 6:26 - 6:58 Found a promising youtube video that calls two different apis, will pursue that.
