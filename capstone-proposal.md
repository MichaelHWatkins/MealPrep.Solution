Michael Watkins
Meal Prep Planner

Purpose: To help people find tasty recipes to put into their meal prep calendar.

MVP features: Ability to access different recipes and put them into a daily planner. This will include saving up to a weeks worth of meal plans and persisting information in a mysql database. 

Tools etc: C#/.Net, MySQL, Spoontacular API.

Stretch goals: An interactive Month Calendar that you can click on different days to see what you have planned for food. User authentication is achieved by users creating a spoonacular account and inputing their unique hash code and username into a form that will allow them to access their specific calendar.

Stretch goal tools: Mainly a more indepth understanding of how spoonacular interacts with data and what is possible with it. At this point I think that my stretch goals will be achievable purely through the use of spoonaculars great api, but I haven't dug enough into it yet to know if my stretch goals will need additional tools or not.
